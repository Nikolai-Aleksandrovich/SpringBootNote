# 一、abstract

We focus on the problem of location recommendation to taxi drivers. We provide a taxi recommendation system based on network embedding on taxi pickup history data set and POI data set of New York, which means when the prospective profit and pick-up rate are maximized and the Wandering time and opportunity cost are minimized,we can calculate the best location for a specific taxi driver. we  mining the deep relation of the feature of taxi pickup historical data set. after learning the representation of data set,a recommendation system is built, finally a series of methods are implemented to improves the accuracy of recommendation, the taxi utilization time, and reduces the cost of empty vehicle operation. This method is especially suitable for solving feature extraction and target points under a large amount of historical taxi pickup data.

# 二、Introduction

The wide application of GPS technology provides better technical and theoretical support for mobile services, which promote the huge amount  of recommendation systems based on historical data of taxi GPS pickups. However,most existing taxi recommendation systems recommend several routes or hot spots for drivers to choose based on the current location and time information to weigh the balance between maximizing passenger opportunities and maximizing revenue. 

In the real world, it is obviously not enough to just mine the taxi passenger mode based on the historical data of taxi passenger load;In addition, how to evaluate a location is more worthy to recommend? How to deal with the various features in pickup historical data? so that it can better reflect the real-time changes of traffic demand in a certain place; improvement and adjustment are still worthy to propose and implement. when a taxi drop-off a passenger,he will find next passenger as soon as possible for profit. Most drivers(Especially inexperienced drivers) will drive along the road and turn to another street randomly at the next turn,which will lead to a Inefficient income model. Our goal is to recommend a best location based on the specific location and time this taxi in,We provide a taxi recommendation system based on network embedding on taxi pickup history data set and POI data set of New York,which the prospective profit and pick-up rate are maximized and the Wandering time and opportunity cost are minimized,so a best location for a specific

There are multiple challenges unique to our problem.
